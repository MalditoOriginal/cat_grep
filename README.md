Certainly, I'll combine the two `README.md` templates for your custom `cat` and `grep` utilities into a single comprehensive `README.md`. Here's the unified `README.md`:

## Introduction

This repository houses two custom command-line utilities, one for enhanced file concatenation (`cat`) and the other for advanced text searching (`grep`). These utilities come with additional flags to provide extra functionality beyond their standard counterparts.

## Custom Cat Utility

### Usage

To use the custom `cat` utility, you can run it from the command line, providing the desired flags and the path to the file you want to manipulate. Here's a basic usage example:

```shell
./custom-cat [FLAGS] [FILE]
```

Replace `[FLAGS]` with one or more of the flags described below and `[FILE]` with the path to the file you want to process.

### Flags for `cat`

- `-b (GNU: --number-nonblank)`: Numbers only non-empty lines in the output.
- `-e (GNU: -E, implies -v)`: Implies `-v` but also displays end-of-line characters as `$`.
- `-n (GNU: --number)`: Numbers all output lines.
- `-s (GNU: --squeeze-blank)`: Squeezes multiple adjacent blank lines.
- `-t (GNU: -T, implies -v)`: Implies `-v` but also displays tabs as `^I`.

### Installation for `cat`

## Custom Grep Utility

### Usage for `grep`

To use the custom `grep` utility, you can run it from the command line, providing the desired flags and the pattern you want to search for. Here's a basic usage example:

```shell
./custom-grep [FLAGS] pattern [FILE]
```

Replace `[FLAGS]` with one or more of the flags described below, `pattern` with the search pattern, and `[FILE]` with the path to the file(s) you want to search within.

### Flags for `grep`

- `-e pattern`: Allows you to specify the search pattern.
- `-i (Ignore uppercase vs. lowercase)`: Makes the search case-insensitive.
- `-v (Invert match)`: Inverts the match, showing lines that do not contain the specified pattern.
- `-c (Output count of matching lines only)`: Counts and outputs the number of lines that match the pattern.
- `-l (Output matching files only)`: Outputs the names of files that contain the search pattern.
- `-n (Precede each matching line with a line number)`: Precedes each matching line with a line number.
- `-h (Output matching lines without preceding them by file names)`: Suppresses the display of file names when outputting matching lines.
- `-s (Suppress error messages about nonexistent or unreadable files)`: Suppresses error messages related to nonexistent or unreadable files.
- `-f file (Take regexes from a file)`: Allows you to read search patterns from a file.
- `-o (Output the matched parts of a matching line)`: Outputs only the matched parts of a matching line.

### Installation for `grep`

This unified `README.md` now provides comprehensive information about both your custom `cat` and `grep` utilities in a single document. You can copy and paste this template into your `README.md` file and customize it with any additional details or specific instructions.
